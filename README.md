# SQL-Data-Analysis-LEGO-Database-

The project dataset is from LEGO Catalog Database- Source-https://rebrickable.com/downloads/

In this project, I used Rebrickable LEGO Data model and created database in MSSQL server to analyse real scenarios of answering questions about data using SQL. Have used advanced SQL queries to explore complex problems using JOINS,CTEs and WINDOW functions.

Used SSIS to import files into database.
